added support for smart match:
when enabled, any whisper containing one of the invite keywords, will trigger an invite
the keywords must be a separate word, for example, "inviteme please" would not trigger the "invite" or "inv" keywords; but would trigger "inviteme"

added support for triggering on outgoing whispers:
when enabled, sending a trigger word to someone will invite/guildinvite them. invite and guildinvite can be enabled/disabled separately

type "/iow toggleSmartMatch" to enable/disable smart match
type "/iow toggleOutgoingTrigger ginv" or "/iow toggleOutgoingTrigger inv" to enable/disable triggering from outgoing whispers
